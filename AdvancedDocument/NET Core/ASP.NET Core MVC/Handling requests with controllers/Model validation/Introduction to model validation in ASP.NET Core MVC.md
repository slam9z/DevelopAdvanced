[Introduction to model validation in ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/validation)

## Introduction to model validation

Before an app stores data in a database, the app must validate the data. Data must be checked for potential security threats, verified that it is appropriately formatted by type and size, and it must conform to your rules. Validation is necessary although it can be redundant and tedious to implement. In MVC, validation happens on both the client and server.

Fortunately, .NET has abstracted validation into validation attributes. These attributes contain validation code, thereby reducing the amount of code you must write.

## Validation Attributes


## Model State


## Custom validation


## Client side validation
