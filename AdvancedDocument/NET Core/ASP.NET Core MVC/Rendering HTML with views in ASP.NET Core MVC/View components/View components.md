[View components](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/view-components)

## Introducing view components

New to ASP.NET Core MVC, view components are similar to partial views, but they are much more powerful. View components donâ€™t use model binding, and only depend on the data you provide when calling into it. A view component:


* Renders a chunk rather than a whole response

* Includes the same separation-of-concerns and testability benefits found between a controller and view

* Can have parameters and business logic

* Is typically invoked from a layout page

View components are intended anywhere you have reusable rendering logic that is too complex for a partial view, such as:


* Dynamic navigation menus

* Tag cloud (where it queries the database)

* Login panel

* Shopping cart

* Recently published articles

* Sidebar content on a typical blog

* A login panel that would be rendered on every page and show either the links to log out or log in, depending on the
* log in state of the user


A view component consists of two parts: the class (typically derived from ViewComponent) and the result it returns (typically a view). Like controllers, a view component can be a POCO, but most developers will want to take advantage of the methods and properties available by deriving from ViewComponent.
