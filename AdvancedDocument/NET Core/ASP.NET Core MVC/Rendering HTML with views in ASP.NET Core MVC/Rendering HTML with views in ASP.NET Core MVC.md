[Rendering HTML with views in ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/overview)


## What are Views?

In the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, the view encapsulates the presentation details of the user's interaction with the app. Views are HTML templates with embedded code that generate content to send to the client. Views use Razor syntax, which allows code to interact with HTML with minimal code or ceremony.

ASP.NET Core MVC views are .cshtml files stored by default in a Views folder within the application. Typically, each controller will have its own folder, in which are views for specific controller actions.
