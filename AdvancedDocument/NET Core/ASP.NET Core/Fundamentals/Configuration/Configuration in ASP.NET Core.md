[Configuration in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration)

The configuration API provides a way of configuring an app based on a list of name-value pairs that can be read at runtime from multiple sources. The name-value pairs can be grouped into a multi-level hierarchy. There are configuration providers for:

* File formats (INI, JSON, and XML)
* Command-line arguments
* Environment variables
* In-memory .NET objects
* An encrypted user store
* Azure Key Vault
* Custom providers, which you install or create

Each configuration value maps to a string key. Thereâ€™s built-in binding support to deserialize settings into a custom POCO object (a simple .NET class with properties).
