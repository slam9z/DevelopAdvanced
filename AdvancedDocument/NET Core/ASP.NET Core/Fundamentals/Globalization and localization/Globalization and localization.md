[Globalization and localization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/localization)

Creating a multilingual website with ASP.NET Core will allow your site to reach a wider audience. ASP.NET Core provides services and middleware for localizing into different languages and cultures.

Internationalization involves Globalization and Localization. Globalization is the process of designing apps that support different cultures. Globalization adds support for input, display, and output of a defined set of language scripts that relate to specific geographic areas.

Localization is the process of adapting a globalized app, which you have already processed for localizability, to a particular culture/locale. For more information see Globalization and localization terms near the end of this document.

App localization involves the following:


* Make the app's content localizable

* Provide localized resources for the languages and cultures you support

* Implement a strategy to select the language/culture for each request
