[Protecting an API using Passwords](https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/release/quickstarts/2_resource_owner_passwords.html)


The OAuth 2.0 resource owner password grant allows a client to send username and password to the token service and get an access token back that represents that user.

The spec recommends using the resource owner password grant only for “trusted” (or legacy) applications. Generally speaking you are typically far better off using one of the interactive OpenID Connect flows when you want to authenticate a user and request access tokens.

Nevertheless, this grant type allows us to introduce the concept of users to our quickstart IdentityServer, and that’s why we show it.
