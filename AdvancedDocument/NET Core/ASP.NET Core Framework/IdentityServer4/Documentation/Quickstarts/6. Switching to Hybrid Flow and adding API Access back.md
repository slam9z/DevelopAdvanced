[Switching to Hybrid Flow and adding API Access back](https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/release/quickstarts/5_hybrid_and_api_access.html)

In the previous quickstarts we explored both API access and user authentication. Now we want to bring the two parts together.

The beauty of the OpenID Connect & OAuth 2.0 combination is, that you can achieve both with a single protocol and a single round-trip to the token service.

In the previous quickstart we used the OpenID Connect implicit flow. In the implicit flow all tokens are transmitted via the browser, which is totally fine for the identity token. Now we also want to request an access token.

Access tokens are a bit more sensitive than identity tokens, and we don’t want to expose them to the “outside” world if not needed. OpenID Connect includes a flow called “Hybrid Flow” which gives us the best of both worlds, the identity token is transmitted via the browser channel, so the client can validate it before doing any more work. And if validation is successful, the client opens a back-channel to the token service to retrieve the access token.
