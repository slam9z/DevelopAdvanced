[Adding User Authentication with OpenID Connect](https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/release/quickstarts/3_interactive_login.html)



## Adding the UI

All the protocol support needed for OpenID Connect is already built into IdentityServer. You need to provide the necessary UI parts for login, logout, consent and error.

While the look & feel as well as the exact workflows will probably always differ in every IdentityServer implementation, we provide an MVC-based sample UI that you can use as a starting point.

## Creating an MVC client

Next you will add an MVC application to your solution. Use the ASP.NET Core “Web Application” template for that. Configure the application to use port 5002 (see the overview part for instructions on how to do that).


## Adding support for OpenID Connect Identity Scopes

Similar to OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect also uses the scopes concept. Again, scopes represent something you want to protect and that clients want to access. In contrast to OAuth, scopes in OIDC don’t represent APIs, but identity data like user id, name or email address.


## Adding a client for OpenID Connect implicit flow

The last step is to add a new client to IdentityServer.

OpenID Connect-based clients are very similar to the OAuth 2.0 clients we added so far. But since the flows in OIDC are always interactive, we need to add some redirect URLs to our configuration.
