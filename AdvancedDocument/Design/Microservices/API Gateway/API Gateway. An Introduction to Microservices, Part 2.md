[API Gateway. An Introduction to Microservices,](https://auth0.com/blog/an-introduction-to-microservices-part-2-API-gateway/)


## What is an API gateway and why use it?

In all service-based architectures there are several concerns that are shared among all (or most) services. A microservice-based architecture is not an exception. As we said in the first post, microservices are developed almost in isolation. Cross-cutting concerns are dealt with by upper layers in the software stack. The API gateway is one of those layers. Here is a list of common concerns handled by API gateways:

* Authentication
* Transport security
* Load-balancing
* Request dispatching (including fault tolerance and service discovery)
* Dependency resolution
* Transport transformations
