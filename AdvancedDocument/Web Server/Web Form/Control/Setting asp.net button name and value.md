[Setting asp.net button name and value](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20353483/setting-asp-net-button-name-and-value)

##Question

It appears that ASP.NET WebForms automatically sets the values of the name and value attributes with the value of the ID attribute 
for an asp:Button. How dou you set custom values for those attributes?
 I tried it with ```MyButton.Attributes["name"] = "CustomName" ```

but then i have two name attributes in generated html. 
I would like to use custom values to determine which button was clicked during a postback.
 I don't want to use CommandName or CommandArgument because when a postback occurs I just want to check for name and value. 
I don't want to care about whether a handwritten input element 

(like ```<input type="submit" name="buttons" value="abc"></input>```) 
caused the postback or a input element generated by asp.net



##Answer 

You can use ClientIDMode property to static. However, you need to make sure that ID is unique within a page. 
ASPX

```aspx
<asp:Button runat="server" ID="CustomButton" Text="abc" ClientIDMode="Static" />
```

Render HTML

```html
<input type="submit" name="CustomButton" value="abc" id="CustomButton" />
```

Unfortunately this requires ASP.NET 4. I use 3.5. – user764754 Dec
