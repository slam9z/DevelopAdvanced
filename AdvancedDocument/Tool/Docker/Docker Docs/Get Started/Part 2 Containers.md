[Part 2: Containers](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/)

## Introduction

It’s time to begin building an app the Docker way. We’ll start at the bottom of the hierarchy of such an app, which is a container, which we cover on this page. Above this level is a service, which defines how containers behave in production, covered in Part 3. Finally, at the top level is the stack, defining the interactions of all the services, covered in Part 5.

## Your new development environment


## Define a container with a Dockerfile

Define a container with a Dockerfile

Dockerfile will define what goes on in the environment inside your container. Access to resources like networking interfaces and disk drives is virtualized inside this environment, which is isolated from the rest of your system, so you have to map ports to the outside world, and be specific about what files you want to “copy in” to that environment. However, after doing that, you can expect that the build of your app defined in this Dockerfile will behave exactly the same wherever it runs.
Dockerfile

Create an empty directory and put this file in it, with the name Dockerfile. Take note of the comments that explain each statement.

```conf
# Use an official Python runtime as a base image
FROM python:2.7-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
ADD . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

This Dockerfile refers to a couple of things we haven’t created yet, namely app.py and requirements.txt. Let’s get those in place next.


## Recap and cheat sheet (optional)

Here’s a terminal recording of what was covered on this page:

Here is a list of the basic commands from this page, and some related ones if you’d like to explore a bit before moving on.

```
docker build -t friendlyname .  # Create image using this directory's Dockerfile
docker run -p 4000:80 friendlyname  # Run "friendlyname" mapping port 4000 to 80
docker run -d -p 4000:80 friendlyname         # Same thing, but in detached mode
docker ps                                 # See a list of all running containers
docker stop <hash>                     # Gracefully stop the specified container
docker ps -a           # See a list of all containers, even the ones not running
docker kill <hash>                   # Force shutdown of the specified container
docker rm <hash>              # Remove the specified container from this machine
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)           # Remove all containers from this machine
docker images -a                               # Show all images on this machine
docker rmi <imagename>            # Remove the specified image from this machine
docker rmi $(docker images -q)             # Remove all images from this machine
docker login             # Log in this CLI session using your Docker credentials
docker tag <image> username/repository:tag  # Tag <image> for upload to registry
docker push username/repository:tag            # Upload tagged image to registry
docker run username/repository:tag                   # Run image from a registry
```
