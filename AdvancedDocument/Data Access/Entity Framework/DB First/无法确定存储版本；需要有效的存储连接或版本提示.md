[Entity Framework: The provider did not return a providermanifest instance](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19574981/entity-framework-the-provider-did-not-return-a-providermanifest-instance)



In my case I had to hack the .EDMX file and change the ProviderManifestToken="2008"

1. Open your Model.edmx in editor
1. Change the ProviderManifestToken="2012" to ProviderManifestToken="2008"
