[HTML <meta> element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta)

The HTML `<meta>` element represents any metadata information that cannot be represented by one of the other HTML meta-related elements `(<base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>)`.

Depending on the attributes set, the kind of metadata can be one of the following:

* If [name](#name) is set, it is document-level metadata, applying to the whole page.
* If [http-equiv]() is set, it is a pragma directive, i.e. information normally given by the web server about how the web page should be served.
* If [charset]() is set, it is a charset declaration, i.e. the charset used for the serialized form of the webpage.
* If [itemprop]() is set, it is user-defined metadata, transparent for the user-agent as the semantics of the metadata is user-specific.
