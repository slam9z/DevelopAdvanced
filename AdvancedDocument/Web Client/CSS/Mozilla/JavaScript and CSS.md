There are three ways to do this:

* By working with the document's list of stylesheets—for example: adding, removing or modifying a stylesheet.
* By working with the rules in a stylesheet—for example: adding, removing or modifying a rule.
* By working with an individual element in the DOM—modifying its style independently of the document's stylesheets
