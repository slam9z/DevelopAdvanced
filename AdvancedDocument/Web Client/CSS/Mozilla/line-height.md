[line-height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height)

* On block level elements, the line-height property specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element.

* On non-replaced inline elements, line-height specifies the height that is used to calculate line box height. 

* On replaced inline elements such as buttons or other input elements, line-height has no effect.
