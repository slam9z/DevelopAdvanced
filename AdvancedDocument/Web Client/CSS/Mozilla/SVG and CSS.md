[SVG and CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/SVG_and_CSS)

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based language for creating graphics.

It can be used for static images, and also for animations and user interfaces.

Like other XML-based languages, SVG supports CSS stylesheets so that you can separate the style of a graphic from its content.

Also, stylesheets that you use with other document markup languages can specify the URL of an SVG graphic where an image is required. 

For example, a stylesheet that you use with an HTML document can specify the URL of an SVG graphic in the value of a background property.
