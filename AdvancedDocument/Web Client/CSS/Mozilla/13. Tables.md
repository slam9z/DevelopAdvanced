[Tables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Tables)


##Table structure

##Borders

Cells have no margins.

Cells do have borders and padding. By default, the borders are separated by the value of the table's *border-spacing* property. 
You can also remove the spacing completely by setting the table's *border-collapse* property to collapse.


##Captions

A [<caption>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption) element is a label that applies to the entire table. 
By default, it is displayed at the top of the table.

To move it to the bottom, set its [caption-side](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/caption-side) property to bottom. 
The property is inherited, so alternatively you can set it on the table or another ancestor element.


##Empty cells

You can display empty cells (that is, their borders and backgrounds) by specifying [empty-cells](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/empty-cells)
: show; for the table element.
