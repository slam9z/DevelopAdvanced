##User interfaces

CSS has some special properties for devices that support a user interface, like computer displays. 
These make the document's appearance change dynamically as the user works with the interface.

There is no special media type for devices with user interfaces.

There are five special selectors:

|Selector| Selects| 
|-------|-------|
|E:hover |Any E element that has the pointer over it |
|E:focus |Any E element that has keyboard focus |
|E:active |The E element that is involved in the current user action |
|E:link| Any E element that is a hyperlink to a URL that the user has not visited recently |
|E:visited| Any E element that is a hyperlink to a URL that the user has visited recently |


The cursor property specifies the shape of the pointer: Some of the common shapes are as follows.
 Place your mouse over the items in this list to see the actual pointer shapes in your browser:

| Selector | Selects | 
|-------|-------|
| pointer | Indicating a link | 
| wait | Indicating that the program cannot accept input | 
| progress | Indicating that the program is working, but can still accept input|  
| default|  The default (usually an arrow) |
