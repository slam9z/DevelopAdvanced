[XML data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/XML_data)

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a general-purpose language for any kind of structured data.

By default, your Mozilla browser displays XML in a format very similar to the original data in the XML file.
 You see the actual tags that define the data's structure.

By linking a CSS stylesheet with the XML document, you can define other ways to display it. 
To do this, your stylesheet uses rules that map tags in the XML document to the display types used by HTML.
