[.append()](http://api.jquery.com/append/)

在生成html的时候很好用，如果ajax返回的列表使用string拼接估计我会发疯。

The .append() method inserts the specified content as the last child of each element in the jQuery
 collection (To insert it as the first child, use .prepend()).

The .append() and .appendTo() methods perform the same task. The major difference is in the syntax-specifically, in the
 placement of the content and target. With .append(), the selector expression preceding the method is the container into 
which the content is inserted. With .appendTo(), on the other hand, the content precedes the method, either as a selector 
expression or as markup created on the fly, and it is inserted into the target container.
