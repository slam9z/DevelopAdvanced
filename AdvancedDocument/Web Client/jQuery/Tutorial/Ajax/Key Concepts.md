##GET vs. POST


##Data Types

* script

* jsonp


##Same-Origin Policy and JSONP

In general, Ajax requests are limited to the same protocol (http or https), the same port,
 and the same domain as the page making the request. This limitation does not apply to scripts 
that are loaded via jQuery's Ajax methods.
